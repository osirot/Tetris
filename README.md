# Tetris

This is a simlple Java Tetris game I constructed. 

There are 7 pieces that can be moved by using left, right, down arrows on keyboard. 
The space bar can also be used for down movement of piece. 
The keyboard letter "R" is  for piece rotation. 
Use "R" button if you are playing and want to rotate your piece 90 degrees counter clockwise. 

The tetris.java file holds the main method to run the app. Download all, compile, and run.

HAVE FUN PLAYING!!
